<p>The Ramayana</p>
<h3 id="book-author">book author</h3>
<p>The name Rāmāyaṇa is composed of two words, Rāma and ayaṇa. Rāma, the name of the main character of the epic, has two contextual meanings. In the Atharvaveda, it means 'dark, dark-coloured, black' and is related to the word rātri which means 'darkness or stillness of night'. </p>

<p>The Ramayana (/rɑːˈmɑːjənə/;[1][2] Sanskrit: रामायणम्, romanized: Rāmāyaṇam[3]) is a Sanskrit epic from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism, the other being the Mahābhārata.[4] Together, they form the core of Hindu religious history. The epic, traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala. The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across forests in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana; the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana, the king of Lanka, that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya along with Sita to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration.

The scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text ranging from the 8th to 4th centuries BCE,[5][6] and later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE,[7] although original date of composition is unknown. It is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature and consists of nearly 24,000 verses (mostly set in the Shloka/Anuṣṭubh metre), divided into seven kāṇḍa (chapters) the first and the seventh being later additions.[8]</p>
